# Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State
## Description:
```
A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array board. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters " ", "X", and "O".  The " " character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

    Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
    The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places "O" characters.
    "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
    The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
    The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
    No more moves can be played if the game is over.
```
### Example 1:
```
Input: board = ["O  ", "   ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: board = ["XOX", " X ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: board = ["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]
Output: false
```
### Example 4:
```
Input: board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]
Output: true
```
### Note:

   - board is a length-3 array of strings, where each string board[i] has length 3.
   - Each board[i][j] is a character in the set {" ", "X", "O"}.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool ifWin(vector<string>& board,char piece)
    {
        int count3=0,count4=0;
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
        {
            int count1=0,count2=0;
            if(board[i][i]==piece) count3++;
            if(board[i][2-i]==piece) count4++;
            for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
            {
                if(board[i][j]==piece) count1++;
                if(board[j][i]==piece) count2++;
            }      
            if(count1==3||count2==3) return true;
        }
        if(count3==3||count4==3) return true;
        else return false;
    }
    
    
    
    bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board) {
        int countX=0,countO=0;
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
            for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
            {
                if(board[i][j]=='X') countX++;
                else if(board[i][j]=='O') countO++;
            }
        if(countX<countO||countX-countO>1) return false;
        if(ifWin(board,'X')&&countX==countO) return false;
        if(ifWin(board,'O')&&countX!=countO) return false;
        return true;
                
    }
};
```
*********************************
这题主要是分类讨论，以下几种情况为false：

- ‘O’数量比‘X’多，因为先下‘X’；
- ‘X‘数比’O‘多2及以上；
- 第一位玩家赢了而‘O’数不少于‘X’；
- 第二位玩家赢了而‘X’数不等于‘O’。

出去以上几种情况外均为true，由此写出代码即可。
